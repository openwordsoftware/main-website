<p>Thank you for agreeing to take time to assist with this project.

<p>The 1.0 release will be English and Spanish only (although it will be capable of using any language infobase from the Message Hub)</p>

<p>This pre-release is to gain feedback on project direction as well as specific feedback on features and bugs.</p>

<p>At this point many major features have been implemented. Including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Browsing and viewing Messages and Bible</li>
  <li>Copy and paste out of Message and Bible</li>
  <li>Searching Message and Bible</li>
  <li>Search term highlighting and jumping into text</li>
  <li>Live hit totals when searching</li>
  <li>Search results paging</li>
  <li>Cross references from Bro Mamalis</li>
  <li>Changing basic settings on documents</li>
  <li>Settings persist across sessions</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to get your input on:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The overall direction of the project.</li>
  <li>The overall design, window docking, treeview menu etc.</li>
  <li>What your ideal search experience would be like
    <ul>
      <li>Do you prefer live hit counts for each word?</li>
      <li>Do you prefer word prediction?</li>
      <li>How would you like search scoping to work? (ie limiting search to just one Message or a single year)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Show stopping bugs</li>
  <li>General user experience feedback</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Windows 10 (version 1607 "Anniversary Update" or newer)
or Windows 8.1
or Windows 7 SP1 with Platform Update
1GHz processor (dual-core recommended)
1GB of RAM
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Message Hub for Desktop depends on Microsoft’s .NET Framework 4.5.1 or greater, which is automatically installed if it isn’t already on the system.</p>

<p>Message Hub for Desktop uses your hard drive to store infobase files that are included in the installer and any that you might download. Because of this, actual disk space requirements will depend on the number of infobases you install. However, the largest infobases are still less than 100MB each.</p>
